# Lesson 2 - Styling a React app

## Introduction

In an app created with Create React App, regular CSS is used for styling.

In `src/App.js`, there is an example of the CSS being imported.

```js
import "./App.css";
```

The styles imported here will apply globally to the app. If you wanted to import styles that would only apply locally to the component in which they are imported, you can CSS Modules (discussed below).

This lesson looks at three other methods for styling a React app:

-   Sass
-   CSS Modules
-   Styled Components

The currently popular Tailwind CSS is also briefly mentioned.

If you are happy to use Sass and don't want to get confused looking at all methods, you can skip the others and come back to them another time.

### CSS Modules

### Styled Components

A big benefit of using Styled Components is being able to pass in a prop to the styled component (it is a component after all) and change styles based on the value of that prop.
