<!-- # Lesson 3

## Introduction

The best thing about React components is that they are reusable. Once written, we can simply import them and use them. We can also import components written by other developers.

## React UI Libraries

There are several React UI libraries of varying quality, with <a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank">Material-UI</a>, <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank">Ant Design</a> and <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/" target="_blank">React Bootstrap being three of the most popular ones.

We are going to look at React Boostrap as we are already familiar with Bootstrap and this library, while not the most exciting, is easy to set up and use.

## Using React Bootstrap

> Note on app names: don't call your React app the same name as an NPM package you are going to use, for example don't call an app `react-bootstrap`

We'll start with a new app:

```
npx create-react-app react-with-bootstrap
```

Then install the following

```
npm install react-bootstrap
```

In the public/index.html add a link to the latest Bootstrap CDN CSS file, just as you would for a non-React site. -->
